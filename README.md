# Code Labs Academy - Quiz App

## Introduction

This is one of the coding challenges for **Unit 1 - The basics** of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn the major concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Project Description

In this project, we will override an existing Javascript and HTML code with extra functionalities.

By solving this project, you will learn :
- how to read existing project's codebase.
- how to add functionalities to existing projects on github
- hot to manipulate the DOM and create events within javascript.

Starting with the code supplied. First read the code thoroughly, then follow these steps in order to finish the project :
- Add a timer for the whole quiz and disable inputs after time elapsed.
- Change some colors to red when timer reaches 0.
- Add a reset button to reset the quiz (ex: reset colors from red to default - reset timer - reset score ...)
- Add a form to accept new questions.
    <!-- // hint: create new input => grab the value => push it to the array of questions => load quiz again -->
- Provide multiple quizzes that can be solved and track the overall score of all the quizzes.

> ## Hints & Resources
> Trying to do this project on your own will help you develop yourself in a huge way as you will learn many new concepts.
>
> But to make this experience a bit easier on beginners just starting JavaScript, and make it less time consuming, we included a milestone with a list of issues that will walk you through the process of building this project and give you hints and pieces of code to make your life easier.

Feel free to do this project on your own, or take a glance at the provided hints.

**Happy coding!** ðŸ˜„
